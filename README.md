# RubySH

Just a small script showing how to run `Bash` inside `Ruby` (multiple options).

**NOTE:** `open3` is most likely not needed to install, but if it is then `gem install open3`.

Clone repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/endormi/rubysh.git
```

Run:

```
ruby rubysh.rb
```

This is a similar type of project ([RubyPy](https://github.com/endormi/rubypy)).
